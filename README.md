## Evidence in Favor of AI Regulation

<blockquote>
  <p style="color: gray;">
Disinformation applications of current and emerging technologies could allow the U.S. to create false speeches or acts from political and religious leaders. Such “footage” might have major geopolitical and diplomatic implications (Warzel, 2018). Of course, these programs will also be available to private, sometimes sophisticated actors, creating another dimension for government to grapple with. These tools can be used to stoke tensions and animosity between and within states and feed false narratives about the past. Leaders will also be able to say that something that did happen did not actually happen.
